**AI-Based Real-Time Drowning Detection System**

This project is an intelligent, real-time drowning detection system that uses computer vision and machine learning to identify drowning behavior from surveillance images and video frames. The system classifies swimmer behavior and triggers automated alerts to notify lifeguards or emergency personnel.

**Features**

- Real-time drowning behavior detection from images
- Trained models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, CNN
- YOLOv8 for object detection (optional extension)
- Alert system: SMS, Email, and Siren (hardware-compatible)
- Streamlit-based web interface for image upload and prediction
- Model comparison and evaluation with accuracy reports
